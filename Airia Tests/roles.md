# Accessablity Notes

## landmark

each group of functionality that makes up a significant part of the screen should be grouped as a landmark.
for example: if you have assets collection and a work order collection on the same screen, you mark the assets part of 
the screen as one landmark and the workorders part of the screen as another landmark.
